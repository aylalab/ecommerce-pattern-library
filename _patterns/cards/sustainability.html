    <p class="max-length">Sustainability has become a buzz word in recent years, but the long-term economic, environmental, and social health of the coffee industry are vital considerations. Reduced biodiversity and farmers living in poverty are just some of the issues involved.</p>
    <p class="max-length">Here at Green Java, we deeply care about the people who farm our coffee, and we make sure that their living and working conditions are always up to par. We also make an effort to reduce our carbon footprint, which is why weâ€™ve developed our packaging to be 100% biodegradable.</p>
